# ConsoleMACAddress
Console program to show the ESP8266 device MAC address

Made with Visual Studio 2019

There is also arduino program to test the console application.

The program uses Serial.h and Serial.cpp made by someone else for use...

If there is a need for bigger data to be receive, increase the buffer size in "main" program, etc. Ip Address, MAC Address etc....
